# A totally normal terminal recording, nothing to see here

This is a totally normal terminal recording, nothing to see here. 

Needs a terminal that supports 256 colors such as xterm. Works optimally on an 80x24 terminal geometry, so resize your terminal before playing.

Decompress it with the command `gzip -d < recording.ttyrec.gz > recording.ttyrec`

Play it with the command `ttyplay recording.ttyrec`.

The `ttyplay` command is available in the `ttyrec` package in most distributions.
